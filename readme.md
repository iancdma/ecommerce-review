# E-Commerce

This task is a challenge for aspiring back-end engineers of BotBros AI

You'll be required to build multiple APIs for a simple e-commerce application which will communicate with one another to accomplish different tasks or features.

## Requirements

There will be two different user roles: _admin_ and _customer_.

### Customer

The customer must be able to see the list of **all** items upon opening the site. In addition, the customer must have the ability to view a list of items displaying the **details** of the **items** according to the **category** requested. The customer can also **specify a certain item** to view all of its details. Lastly, the customer must have the ability to make an order that will include a list of the items he/she ordered and the **total amount** of the items **ordered**.

### Admin

First, the admin must be able to create certain **categories** that later will be attached to the **products**. Afterwards, the admin should be able to create an item under a specified **category**. Then these items (products) will be displayed to the **customers**.

The admin must be able to view the list of all the **orders** made by the customers. Next, the admin can view the list of all **customers**. In addition, if an admin selects a **specific** customer, the customer details must be displayed including all of the **orders** associated to the **customer**.

## Deliverables

You're required to create a public repository, that will soon be used for checking. The repository must contain the following:

* Database Representation in JPG/JPEG or PNG format (ERD, Database Schema, etc)
